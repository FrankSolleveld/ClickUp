# Click Up!
* Game made in typescript for the 4th semester.
* You have to click the football in order to keep it high.

## Idea 
* Hooghouden. You have to click items to make them jump. The objects are not allowed to touch the ground. If that happens, you lose.


### Done
* Background
* CSS
* Ball is moving
* Keeping high


### Todo
* Randomize locations and smoothen the fall.
* Debugging

### Known issues
* Football still stuck when out of screen.
